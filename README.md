dotFiles
------

This repo aims to keep track of my dotfiles (~/.something files) mainly for configuration of text editors/software/random stuff

It also contains some poorly writen (and undocumented) bash scripts in order to gather or setup the configs to the proper places to setup my enviroment quickly

While the scripts tend to be portable between Linux distros it'll probably break for BSD and I can't guarantee it wont nuke your system into orbit or delete your files if your system is different

###Use at your own risk!!!
